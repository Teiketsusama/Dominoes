# Dominoes
> Stage 1
- [X] **Generate a full domino set.** Each domino is represented as a list of two numbers. A full domino set is a list of 28 unique dominoes.
- [X] **Split the full domino set between the players and the stock by random.** 
You should get three parts: Stock pieces (14 domino elements), Computer pieces (7 domino elements), and Player pieces (7 domino elements).
- [X] **Determine the starting piece and the first player.** Modify the parts accordingly. 
You should get four parts with domino pieces and one string indicating the player that goes first: either "player" or "computer".
If the starting piece cannot be determined (no one has a double domino), reshuffle, and redistribute the pieces (step 3).
- [X] Output all five variables.
