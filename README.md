# Dominoes
> Objectives
1. Generate a full domino set. Each domino is represented as a list of two numbers. A full domino set is a list of 28 unique dominoes.
2. Split the full domino set between the players and the stock by random. 
You should get three parts: Stock pieces (14 domino elements), Computer pieces (7 domino elements), and Player pieces (7 domino elements).
3. Determine the starting piece and the first player. Modify the parts accordingly. 
You should get four parts with domino pieces and one string indicating the player that goes first: either "player" or "computer".
If the starting piece cannot be determined (no one has a double domino), reshuffle, and redistribute the pieces (step 3).
4. Output all five variables.
